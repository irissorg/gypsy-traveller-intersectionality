## Development and structure

This resource explores the intersectionality of Gypsy/Traveller identity and provides valuable insight for social work professionals. It platforms the voices of Gypsy/Traveller communities on notions of identity and intersectionality of marginalisation.

It was researched and written by Davie Donaldson, a Scottish Traveller Activist and Social Entrepreneur and founder of [Progress in Dialogue](https://progressindialogue.org.uk/).

### Listen to Davie share what he learned through developing this resource

{{< soundcloud 1023273877 >}}

As part of the research, Davie interviewed several people from the Gypsy/Traveller community to share their personal experiences to inform this resource. These stories were developed into case studies.  The resource is in three sections:

### Context

This provides background to the culture of Gypsy/Traveller communities and explores the relationship social work has had historically with these communities.  \

### Our Voices

Focuses on Gypsy/Traveller lived experience, particularly on gender and LGBTQI+ identity. Through hearing the personal stories of community members, professionals can be more culturally aware and sensitive to inequalities faced by Gypsy/Traveller communities.

### Improving practice: Practical steps

Provide guidance that reflects on the role of social work in understanding Gypsy/Traveller intersectionality – how to embed culturally proficient practice and challenge unconscious bias.  

## Outcomes

Those who use this resource will gain:

* Increased awareness and understanding about Gypsy/Traveller culture and historical relationship with social work
* Increased awareness and knowledge of intersectionality, identities and inequalities
* Improved confidence in challenging unconscious bias
* Improved confidence in culturally sensitive practice with Gypsy/Travellers

## Evaluation
