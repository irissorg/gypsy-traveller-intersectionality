Intersectionality is defined as an analytical framework for understanding how aspects of a person's social and political identities combine to create different modes of discrimination and privilege. Examples of these aspects are gender, caste, sex, race, class, sexuality, religion, disability, physical appearance, and height.

In other words, it is a term attributed to the way of thinking about identity and its relationship to power.

This resource highlights Gypsy/Traveller intersectionality and specific considerations for social work practice. Intersectionality is a crucial methodology for social work as it enables practitioners to fully appreciate an individualâ€™s context, marginalisation and effectively consider safeguarding concerns. Furthermore, intersectional identities can often mean taking a very different approach to engagement and support.
